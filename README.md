# “To keep the body in good health is a duty otherwise we shall not be able to keep our mind strong and clear.”- Buddha.

Keeping this saying in mind which was given by Lord Buddha himself, our topic – ‘Health Tracker’ focuses on one of the most essential things in our life – health. 

Health is the key to both happiness and success in our life.

<br>
<br>
Now, there are various methods and measures to ensure good health. One of the factors which inform us whether a person is healthy or not is his/her BODY MASS INDEX (BMI). 
BMI is a person’s weight in kilograms divided by the square of his/her height in meters. It was basically designed to be used as a simple means of classifying average sedentary populations, with an average body composition.

Depending upon the BMI of a person, he/she is classified as:
<ul>
  <li>Severely underweight – If BMI is less than 16.5 kg/m2.</li>
  <li>Underweight – If BMI is less than 18.5 kg/m2.</li>
  <li>Normal Weight – If BMI is greater than or equal to 18.5 – 24.9 kg/m2.</li>
  <li>Overweight – If BMI is greater than or equal to 25 – 29.9 kg/m2.</li>
  <li>Obesity – If BMI is greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
Also, there are several diseases associated with the different BMI ranges. These diseases may necessarily not be present but there is a possibility for these diseases to be present.
Some of these diseases are:
<ul>
  <li>Underweight – Malnutrition, osteoporosis, etc.</li>
  <li>Overweight/Obesity – Back pain, diabetes, gout, asthma, etc.</li>
</ul>
<br>
In order to remain healthy, we need to have a balance of everything. One must have a proper diet as well as a proper fitness regime.
<br>
<br>
A proper diet basically refers to a balanced diet which is a diet containing all nutrients in adequate amounts, A balanced diet include a variety of items:
<ul>
  <li>Fruits</li>
  <li>Vegetables</li>
  <li>Grains</li>
  <li>Protein foods, etc.</li>
</ul>


Also, the User can get to know how much Calories he/she needs to eat in order to either Gain/Lose weight. A Mathematical Formula is used in the algorithm which takes into account the daily physical activities of the user before calculating the desired Calories.

Also, users would be able to see how much quantity (in grams) of the main 3 Macronutrients - carbohydrate, Fat, and Protein they must incorporate in their diet in order to reach their Calorie target calculated earlier.

<br>
For e.g. A 40-year-old Woman, who weighs 70 kg and is 160 cm tall and does Light Activity daily needs to eat 169.7 gm Carbohydrates,113.1 gm Proteins and 41.9 gm Fats daily in order to lose weight. 

Also, the program takes into account the user’s family disease history, age and BMI in order to suggest if they have risk of developing Diabetes or Stroke in the future. 

Thus, our topic is very useful and, more importantly it provides a convenient and easy way to keep our health in check.

<br>
Our Program can be improved further by incorporating sensors along with Machine Learning Algorithms in order to accurately get data from the user and give out an accurate result and prediction for the user.

This kind of a program can be widely used in the Health Care Sector in order to reduce manual load for data input and analysis in Hospitals. This can also play a role in combating the problem of shortage of Doctors (required for Basic Check-up in this case) in India.
